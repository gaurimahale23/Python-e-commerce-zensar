This project is my first full-stack e-commerce website built using Python, HTML, CSS, and MySQL. I designed the front end with HTML and CSS to create simple, clean pages where users can easily browse through products, add items to their cart, and navigate across different sections of the site. Layout is simple, making the shopping experience straightforward.

On the backend, I used Python to handle logic. This includes managing user accounts, where customers can sign up and log in, as well as handling product details, updating inventory, processing orders, and connecting to the database. Python works quietly behind the scenes to make sure all these tasks run every time a user interacts with the platform. It ensures orders are confirmed and inventory is updated in real time, giving customers and admins reliable service.

For storing data, I set up a MySQL database using SQL scripts. The database organizes all the necessary information into tables—for products, users, orders, and transactions—keeping everything structured and easy to manage. This helps the system know what products are available, who the customers are, what they’ve bought, and maintain accurate records of transactions for future reference.

I built this project to learn how the different parts of a web application work together—from the user interface they interact with to how data flows behind the scenes. It was a valuable experience in combining frontend web design with backend programming and database management. This project helped me understand the practical challenges and essential components of a real-world e-commerce platform. Overall, this e-commerce site is a solid foundation in full-stack development that demonstrates my ability to create a functional, integrated web application. It prepares me to take on more advanced projects and deepen my skills in web technologies while providing hands-on experience in building a real, working online store.
